/**
 * @page kns_q_page OS queue utilities
 *
 * This page is presenting the utilities to manipulate queues used in kineis_sw.
 *
 * @section kns_q_intro Introduction
 *
 * As on lots of OS, queues are used by kineis SW environement (kineis stack + application) to
 * share events and data between different tasks/ISR contexts. Source SW entity (task) pushes
 * event+data into the queue from one context (e.g. ISR) and the destination layer (task) will pop
 * it from its own context.
 *
 * @section kns_q_list List of queues
 *
 * Kineis OS does not assume any priorities between tasks directly. But it is done through the side
 * effect of priorities declared on queues. An event delivered in a high-priority queues shall be
 * consumed as soon as possible by the dedicated task.
 *
 * From global kineis SW architecture, below is some example of queues used between ISR/TASK
 * contexts. It is sorted from lowest to highest priority order:
 * * 3: KNS_Q_DL_APP2MAC used from application to Kinéis stack (MAC internal component)
 * * 2: KNS_Q_UL_MAC2APP used from Kinéis stack to application (MAC internal component)
 * * 1: KNS_Q_UL_SRVC2MAC internally used internally in Kineis stack, to send end-of-processing
 *      events from RF DRIVER ISRs to task context layer (MAC internal component)
 *
 * @section kns_q_design Design
 *
 * As kineis_sw is fully known, queues above are hardcoded and statically defined as arrays.
 *
 * The size  and content of each queue shall be defined through kns_q.h and kns_q.c. Refer to
 * @ref kns_q_conf_page for some extra details
 *
 * There is write and read pointer to the cells of the array. Roll-over is handled. Check on FIFO
 * full and FIFO empty is done.
 *
 * @attention due to simple FIFO-full mechanism implemented so far, queues needs to be one element
 * longer than expected by the system, in case of baremetaol Kineis OS.
 *
 * A priority is assigned to those queues, meaning some event in higher-priority queue should be
 * executed before lower-priority queue's events (refer to kineis_sw architecture for details).
 *

 * @brief This function is used to create queue

 * This function also handles the correspondence between kineis queue handlers (KNS_Q_handle_t) and
 * RTOS handlers, so that KNS_Q_push/pop can still be used with kineis queue handler references.
 *
 * @note This routine is only useful in case of RTOS. In internal baremetal kineis OS, those queues
 * are directly defined as uint8t arrays during compilation. In case of external RTOS, we need to
 * invoke queue creation routine instead.

 * @param[in] qEltByteSize: length of each element of the queue (in bytes).
