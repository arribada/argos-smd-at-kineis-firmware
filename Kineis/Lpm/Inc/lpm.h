 *          * MGRM_LPM is a skeleton working on most of the STM32 uC
 *          * LPM is adding specifities as per the current platform, i.e. STM32WL55xx uC

/**

 *
 * This page is presenting the low-power-managment code specific to the Kineis reference design
 * example based on STM32WL55xx uC (\ref MGR_LPM).
 *
 * It is in charge to configure the generic low power manager (\ref mgr_lpm_page) to have its LPM
 * (\ref MgrLpm_LPM_t) working on STM32WL55xx uC.
 *
 * It is also in charge to register the Kineis stack client so that the LPM manager knows which LPM
 * to enter at any time of the Kineis protocol (idle phase, TX preparation, TX active, TX done).
 *
 * lpm.c file contains overlaying functions to the mgr_lpm.c.
 *
 * lpm_cli_kstk.c contains how to deduce the allowed LPM (\ref MgrLpm_LPM_t) from Kineis stack
 * ressources status (KNS_MAC_rsrcStatus_t).

 * This function disables GPIOs by:
 * * clocking all ports
 * * Configure all GPIO port pins in Analog Input mode (floating input trigger OFF)
 * * unclocking all ports
 *
 * It is done in a way to save some current drain while GPIOs are not needed.
 *
 * So far, GPIOs are mainly connected to SX1255 transceiver. Thus it is needed when powering ON,
 * TX, RX, SAT detection and so on. transceiver driver will need to set GPIOs to correct state
 * when needed.
 *
 * \note This GPIO could be disabled back at end of RF any action (RX/TX/SAT_DETECT). So far,
 *       it will only go back disabled when entering LPM shutdown mode.
 *
 * \note GPIOs used by peripherals, such as SPI, SWD.JTAG, LPTIM are not disabled here.
 *
 * \todo Disable SWD GPIOs (used for ST-Link debugging) in release build. Note, this will:
 *       * disable SWD attach/debug on a running build
 *       * but it remains possible to reflash by pressing RESET pin/button of the uC at the start
 *       of flashing procedure
