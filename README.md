# Horizon(X) - SMD module firmware AT Kineis commands
## Projects based on STM32WL55

This project aims to port the Kineis stm32 stack on the SMD module developped by Arribada. 

More information about the hardware are defined inside [stm32wl-dev github repository](https://github.com/arribada/stm32wl-dev).

## Configuration
This project is based on krd_2.0.0.0 firmware from Kineis with minor adaptations:
 - CLK configuration
 - Change to USART2
 - Adapt GPIO for power amplifier control
 - Timer prescaler adapted


### State
V0.1 : (2023/11/20) Working test version
